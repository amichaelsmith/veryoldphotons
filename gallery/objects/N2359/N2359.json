  "description": "Despite its complex shape, NGC 2359 is essentially a bubble similar to the <a href='object.html?M52-Bubble'>Bubble Nebula</a>, approximately 30 light years in diameter. The bubble is created by intense radiation pressure generated by the Wolf-Rayet star WR7 near its center. Wolf-Rayet stars are exceptionally hot (up to 200,000K) and are thought be possible progenitors of supernovae. We don't really know if or when WR7 may explode, but if it does, it will briefly be the brightest star in the sky."
