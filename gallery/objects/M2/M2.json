  "description": "M2 is a globar star cluster - one of the largest known. It was the second object added by Charles Messier to his famous catalogue of 'non-comets'. Messier's discovery was in actuality a rediscovery, as the cluster had already been noted in 1746 by Jean-Dominique Maraldi. When viewed through the crude telescopes of Messier's day, this object was thought to be a 'nebula without a star'. The quality of telescopes has dramatically improved over the years such that today we can readily resolve M2 into stars with a modest amateur instrument. Keen-eyed observers are even able to just make out M2 to the naked eye as a faint fuzzy 'star'."
