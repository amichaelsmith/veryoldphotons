  "description": "NGC 2903 is an example of an isolated galaxy that does not appear to belong to a galaxy cluster. These so-called 'field' galaxies are relatively uncommon, as about 80% of all galaxies are gravitationally bound to close-by galactic neighbors. This galaxy is a barred spiral, with its spiral arms originating from the two ends of a large central bar of stars. It is thought that 2/3 of all spirals are barred, and this large population includes our own Milky Way Galaxy.",
