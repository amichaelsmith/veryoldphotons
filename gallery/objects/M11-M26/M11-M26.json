  "description": "With this image, we come face-to-face with an embarrassment of riches. Our first impression is one of countless stars - not a surprise, as we are looking directly into part of the central bulge of our Milky Way Galaxy. These stars are predominantly golden or reddish, just like the coloring of the central bulge in far away <a href='object.html?N3184'> spiral galaxies</a>. Our eye is next drawn to the voids - dark expanses where stars are absent or greatly diminished. These are giant molecular clouds, containing the chemical building blocks of future planetary systems, and perhaps even life. Finally, we begin to pick out small jewels, such as the open star clusters <a href='object.html?M11'> M11 </a>(upper left), M26 (lower right), the globular star cluster NGC 6712 (lower left), and finally the planetary nebula IC 1295 (pale blue disk left of NGC 6712). How many other gems can you find in this scene?",
