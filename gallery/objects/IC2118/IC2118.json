  "description": "Hidden in plain sight is an apt description for IC2118. The brilliant star in the upper left-hand corner is Rigel, the lower right corner of the familiar figure of Orion. The nebula itself spans a extent of five full moons. Easy to locate, very large - why haven't you seen this nebula before? It is exceedingly faint. This image is the result of 15 hours of exposure time using a very sensistive CCD camera. The nebula, possibly the remnant of an ancient supernova, shines by the pale reflected light of nearby Rigel. The suggestion of a witch's head in profile is most obvious when viewed upside down.",
