  "description": "The Great Hercules Cluster is surely one of the most spectacular objects accessible to observers with modest telescopes. It is large - nearly the size of the full moon - and easily resolved into thousands of individual stars. Discovered by Edmond Halley (of comet fame) in 1714, is it just visible to the naked eye on a good night, and easy to find between the two right-most stars of the keystone of Hercules. Use the 'Show Entire Image' tool to reveal NGC 6907, a distant spiral galaxy at the upper left of the image. For extra credit, find the much more distant galaxy IC 4617, about half way between M13 and NGC 6907.",
