  "description": "The Dumbbell Nebula gets its name from its appearance in amateur telescopes, though even there it appears more like an apple core than a dumbbell. M27 is an easy object to observe visually, owing to its relative poximity, large size, and inherent brightness. This planetary nebula is a remnant of a star that expired approximately 15,000 years ago. Instead of exploding as a dramatic supernova, this star expelled its outer layers and contracted as a white dwarf. The shell of gas will continue to expand and dissipate until it blends into the interstellar medium, providing raw material for future generations of stars.",
