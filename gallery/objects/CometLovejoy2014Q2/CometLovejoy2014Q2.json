  "description": "Only a year after discovering comet 2013R1, Terry Lovejoy discovered his fifth comet, 2014Q2. The comet diplays a typically bright central coma and a complex tail of multiple strands. The greenish glow is caused by water and organic molecules fluorescing from the ultraviolet radiation of the sun. 2014Q2 is a periodic comet (meaning that it orbits the sun), but we will have to wait about 11,000 years for its return."
