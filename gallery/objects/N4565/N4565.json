  "description": "NGC 4565 is a classic edge-on spiral galaxy, and like all spirals its overall shape is that of a disk. Our vantage point happens to lie in the same plane as that disk, and so NGC 4564 appears to us as a slender needle. Notice the prominent central bulge, consisting of old yellowish stars. Contrast this with the tapering disk, which shows a somewhat bluish color representative of younger stars. Finally, note the irregular black band of dust bisecting the needle - these are giant molecular clouds obscuring the background stars of the disk. Compare this view to that our own Milky Way Galaxy late on a summer night, and you will note that all of these same features are visible to the naked eye, at a scale that spans the entire sky. Indeed, our view of the Milky Way is also edge-on, because we live in the disk of our galaxy.",
