  "description": "This galaxy pair is a favorite of amateur astronomers in the northern hemisphere. Bode's Galaxy (M81) is the larger of two, and presents a large and detailed view in the eyepiece. Indeed, observers gifted with excellent eyesight and a dark sky have glimpsed M81 with the naked eye - making this the most distant object ever observed without optical aid. The cigar-shaped M82 compensates for its smaller size with drama - in this case with a dramatic starburst formation erupting from the poles of its spiral disk. This effect is thought to have been triggered by tidal forces from a recent (100 million years) close encounter with M81.",
