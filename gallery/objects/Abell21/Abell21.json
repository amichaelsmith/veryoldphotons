  "description": "The Medusa Nebula is so-named because its filaments of green oxygen and red hydrogen gas are said to resemble Medusa's serpentine hair from mythology. Abell 21 was once thought to be a supernova remnant, but a careful study in 1971 demonstrated that it is actually a planetary nebula. This nebula is an extremely difficult object to observe visually, but with the use of narrow-band filters and long exposure times, its presence is revealed with photography."
