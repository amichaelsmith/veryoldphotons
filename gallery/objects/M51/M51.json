  "description": "M51 is perhaps the most dramatic grand-design spiral galaxy accessible to amateur astronomers. Its distinctive spiral arms are readily visible to the eye in a modest telescope under dark skies. The upper spiral arm forms a bridge to the the smaller satellite galaxy NGC 5195, and the two galaxies are gravitationally bound. Note also the small pink blobs decorating the spiral arms - each of these is a major nebula akin to the Orion Nebula in our own galaxy. In 2011, M51 produced a supernova - see the 'Supernova' entry in the display options.",
