  "description": "M33 is the third major galaxy in the Local Group, together with M31 and our own Milky Way. Just visible to the naked eye under a dark sky, M33 is large and diffuse, best seen through binoculars. Note the profusion of nebulae - clouds of hydrogen gas that appear as pink blobs scattered through the spiral arms. Also visible are knots of blue - clusters of young, bright stars. Together, these patches of red and blue reveal a vibrant cosmic community that continues to renew itself.",
