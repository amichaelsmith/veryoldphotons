  "description": "M5 was amongst the earliest globular clusters discovered, by Gottfried Kirch in 1702. As with many such early discoveries, Kirch was really looking for comets when he happened upon M5, looking very much like a comet in his crude early telescope. Imagine his disappointment when, after rechecking his discovery nightly, it never moved - proving that it was only a 'nebula' and not a comet at all. Comet hunting was an extremely popular scientific pursuit throughout the 18th century, because comets were a living laboratory that could be used to prove (or disprove) Newton's recently published laws of motion and laws of universal gravitation. This was done by carefully plotting the position of the comet night after night, and comparing those positions to the ones predicted by the theory. Of course, Newton was proven completely correct, and his theories stood as the definite model for gravitation until Einstein's work in the early 20th century."
