  "description": "Comet Lovejoy 2014R1 is the fourth comet discovered by the dedicated amateur astronomer Terry Lovejoy. This image captures the comet a few hours before sunrise, low in the eastern sky. Several classic comet features are revealed. First, note the very bright coma composed of the material recently vaporized from the surface of the nucleus - itself many times smaller than the coma. Surrounding the coma is the green ion tail, which always points directly away from the sun. Finally, the extended purplish/bluish tail is composed of dust, which tends to stream behind the comet along its direction of travel."
