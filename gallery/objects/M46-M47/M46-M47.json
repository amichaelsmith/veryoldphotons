  "description": "M46 and M47 present a striking pair the late winter southern sky. Despite their apparent proximity, there is no connection in either space or time. M47 (on the right) is 1600 light years away and about 78 million years old. M46 (on the left) is 5500 light years away, and about 3000 million years old. M46 is also notable in that it appears to contain the planetary nebula NGC 2438 (just visible here). However, this is also a chance alignment, as the nebula is about 2900 light years away, roughly halfway along a line between M46 and Earth."
