  "description": "The total solar eclipse of 2017 was my very first experience of totality. In order to prepare, I read extensively, planned exhaustively, and even rehearsed the plan for totality itself. My goal was to strike a balance between imaging and just looking. In this, I was successful. Yet, I was entirely unprepared for the actual experience. It was transcendent beyond my ability to describe in words. If you ever have a chance to experience a total solar eclipse, make it happen. You will not regret it. This image captures the view during the roughly 150 seconds of totality. The delicate corona is so large that it actually extends beyond the boundaries of this frame. Notice the prominences that arc and flare above the surface of the sun. Of course, these features are present every minute of every day - but only revealed to earthbound observers during a total eclipse."
