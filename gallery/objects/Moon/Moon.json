  "description": "Sometimes an image just falls in your lap - such was the case here. I was out in the morning twilight closing up the observatory after a full night of imaging deep sky objects. The crescent moon was so enticing and sky so clear, that on a whim I pointed the scope towards the Moon and took this image. The term '26 days' describes the 'age' of the Moon during its approximately monthly cycle of about 29.5 days."
