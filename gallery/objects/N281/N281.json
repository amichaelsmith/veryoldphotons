  "description": "Discovered in 1883 by E. E. Barnard, this nebula gained its nickname in modern times when it became accessible to a new generation of amateur astronomers equipped with telescopes large enough to grasp its faint light. Of course, we will likely need a new nickname in another generation or so. The nebula is an active star-forming region, with several known Bok globules, each of which is a cocoon for a newly formed star system.",
