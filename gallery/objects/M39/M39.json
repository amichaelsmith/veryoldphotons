  "description": "M39 presents a pleasing highlight in an otherwise crowded field of background Milky Way field stars. To my eye, the shape of the cluster hints at a miniature version of the Hyades - the older and closer cluster that forms the head of Taurus the Bull. The dominance of the blue stars in M39 suggests the cluster is still young - blue stars are the hottest, most massive, and brightest stars. However, their prodigious rate of fuel consumption dooms them to a relatively short life span.",
