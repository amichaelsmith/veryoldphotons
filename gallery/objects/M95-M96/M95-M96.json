  "description": "M95 (lower left) and M96 (upper right) are the two brightest members of a group of galaxies in the constellation Leo. The group consists of at least 8 members, and is thought to be an isolated pocket of the much larger Virgo Supercluster of which we (in the Milky Way Galaxy) are probably an outlying member. M95 is a barred spiral - that is, it has typical spiral arms which appear to originate at either end of a distinct central bar composed primarily of ancient stars. Our own galaxy is thought to be a barred spiral. M96 is an intermediate spiral - showing hints of a central bar, but much closer to being an unbarred spiral. Also note the dark streaks superimposed on M96 - these are giant clouds of dust, containing many of the fundamental building blocks of life.",
