  "description": "Comet Holmes is a periodic comet discovered in 1892. During the early 20th century, this comet was occasionally 'rediscovered' until a careful analysis revealed that these celestial visitors were really just a single comet with an orbital period of 6.9 years. In 2007, the comet underwent a remarkable outburst, brightening any a factor of nearly 500,000 in only 42 hours. During this time, the size of the comet's coma expanded to be nearly the size of the sun - its apparent size from Earth nearly half that of the full moon. This image captures it appearance near peak size and brightness."
