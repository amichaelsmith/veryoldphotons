  "description": "Most spiral galaxies show subtle variations in form, but don't stray too far from a few grand design forms. NGC 772 is an exception - with one dominant spiral arm, its unbalanced appearance gives rise to its nickname. This galaxy is also unusually large - thought to be nearly twice the size of our own Milky Way. NGC 772 sported two supernovae in a single year (2003) - an unusual coincidence, since supernovae are thought to occur only about once every 500 years in a typical galaxy.",
